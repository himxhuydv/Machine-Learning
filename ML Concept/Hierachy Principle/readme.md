# Hierachy Model
---
This principle design is used in the architechture of learning process of complex model,breaking into down large problem into manageable levels of abstraction.(we are talking about abstraction as the hidding of complex thing and showing the essential things .  In this abstraction is term as the for example input 100 pages with input of every point and abrastraction 10 pages of summary this what mean the manageable level of abstraction.)
what we are talking about is core idea of layered organization and decompositon. (**here decompositon term is different.here it's bascially mean taking large complex problem then breaking it's into smaller component.*Divide and conquer* this strategy is applied to the design of model and learning processes.**)
***
  *You can't understand this because it's an abstract concept(An abstract concept is which don't have any physical existence and cannot be experienced through the 5 senses.)*
it's used in the deep learning and reinforcement learning models.

## Why do we use or need of the hierachy Model in the first place?
To reduce the complexity of the complex data.and understand the very important information about  that 
Because a single layer cannot understand-Too many relation,Too many possibilities,Too much information
Imagine this task:

Understand the meaning of a paragraph instantly.

To do that directly you must consider:

Every word

Every relationship

Grammar

Context

Emotion

Intent
ALL at once.

This grows exponentially. This is called combinatorial explosio
Hierachy model decomposed the larger problem into simple solvable problem arranged in levels.
What hierachy do now is make this smaller solvable problem.

**Hierachy exist to reduce that complexcity.**
Hierachical Deep nerual network(for data abstraction)
Hierachical model solved these complexicity using two core inter connected principle:
Decomposition
Abstraction
