## Data Augmentation:
A general term given to a technique of **artifically increasing volumne and the diversity of the dataset**,so that model can analyis the **pattern fast and trained very efficiently primary.**
Applying transformations to existing data without changing its meaning.  
Example (for images):
1.Rotate
2.Flipping
3.Cropping
4.Zooming
5.Adding noise
6.Changing brightness/contrast
Primary used for the prevention of overfitting and underfitting.
**Overfitting:** So,during training model accuracy <90% on training dataset to well it's acurracy
