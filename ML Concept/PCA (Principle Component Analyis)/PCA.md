# PCA(Principle Component Analysis)
This is used to reduced the dimensionality of the dataset.  It remove the noise and redundant /correlated data.  
it keep's the important data which are used for model traning and remove the noise.  It's basically reduced the curse of dimensionality.  It can used to find the data relation of high dimensionality by converting it into small dimensionality so that finding pattern analysis  and relation become easy.  It also used for viusal representation of larger dataset by converting them into small one which can be displayed on. 
Let's take a example: a large data set having correlated feature like this 
###### EASY TO VISUALIZE 
###### AFTER PCA EASY TO PROCESS 
  example:PCA can transform 500d-20d so that human can understand that relation and model can speed increase and accuracy increase.
  #### Linear algebra 
  Why do we need to PCA? 
to reduce large feature into small feature reducing
