# Neural Network   
Also somewhere term as artifical Neural Network.  
It's inspired by the structure and function of the *biological brain*.    
Inspired by the idea or each neuron interconnected to each other.And transferring knowledge from one neuron to next neuron.   
Adaptive conncections to create system that can recognise patterns from the data (what is the context of talking of the adaptive connections?-the dynamially adjusting the connection parameter in term of the pattern analyis on totally new data)  
**In side of *Neural Network***  
1.Mutliple Layers(*each and every layer is interconnected to each other and they share information to each other same like brain does it transfer information from one neuron to the next neurons.*)
2.Multiple Nodes(they share information to the next node)
### How did Neural Network works?explain every topic you know about.
They use on of the mathematical principle knowns as heirarchy principle.
1.Inner layer-In this top layer takes the input. 
2.Hidden layer-do some calculation inside of it.(you can acess this using the frameworks like tensorflow,pytorch)
3.Output layer-they give the output.
 
# So now i am gonna tell you how these thing works?
* Each node of the inner layer takes the same kind of input 
* At first remember each layer is taking the different input but inside a particular layer there are multiple nodes
* And each node is taking same input but one every nodes is doing mathematical operation of weight multiply to the input + bias.
* Weight is consider as how much the input is valuable,bias is consider it some values.
## REMEMBER ONE IMPORTANT THING EACH NODES WILL DO MUTIPLICATION BUT EACH NODE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES OF THE WEIGHT AND BIAS .*AND ASLO REMEMBER ONE THING IS THAT YOU WILL GET THE POWER TO INPUT THE VALUES OF THE WEIGHT AND BIAS AT FIRST TIME.*
* After giving the value first time of the weight and bias it will then automatically generate weight and bias values and do mathematical operation from now on.
* In the last all the values from node goes to end part of layer then will goes from some compression then it will give output.after compression (*can be average,sum,sigmoid function.etc.based on the type of data and required output from user . like the user want the output into the probability form like yes or no kind of.*)will go to the next layer.
* in the end every values that is derived by the mathematical operation of each layer the we do the function (like average,sum,sigmoid function.etc)
* that all the kind of knowledge i have.
