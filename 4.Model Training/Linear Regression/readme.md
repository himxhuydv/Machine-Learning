# Linear Regression 
---
Here we use the core foundation of mathematics of matrices arithmetic.
**Defination**:Linear regression measures the relationship between x and y based on:How much y changes when x changes and how closely the data points fit a straight line,We use a best-fit line to show how the deviation of x from its mean is connected to the deviation of y from its mean.
EQUATION OF LINEAR REGRESSION: 
```y = mx + b```
y=output,dependent on x.    
x=input,independent.  
m=slope,how much y changes when the x changes.  
b=interpreter,the value of the y when the x was 0.  

So,now we have to find the m(slope):
$$
m = \frac{\sum \text{(product of deviations)}}{\sum \text{(square of deviation of x)}}
$$
formula,
$$
m := \frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})(y - \bar{y})}{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}
$$ 
Now we find the b (interpreter):
$$
b=\bar{y}-(m*\bar{x})
$$
