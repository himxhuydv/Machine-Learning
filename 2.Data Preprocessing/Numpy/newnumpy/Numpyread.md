## NUMPY 
numpy stand for numerical python.its a python libary in this we do mathematical operation  over whole list  and get output very fast and it's used in the data manipulation
basically 
##### How numpy help in data manipulation
so basically numpy have alot of mathematical function in built by using these function we can manipulate the data in very differnet ways like example we reshape ,transform clean ..etc.so
##### What numpy really does in machine learning 
1.Linear algebra: we can perform matrices multiplication and transpose and dot product etc just so fast  and in the  Neural networks fundamentally rely on linear algebra every things on matrices and vector so that why numpy used because it can perfrom function over matrices and find vector very easily 
2.Work along pandas: this is a very awesome feature of this libary that it can combined with pandas and do data handling 
3.Random number:so  randomly doing distributing ,splitting data kind of stuff done using random module (np.random)
4.staticies calculation:As u know so many mathematical function are present for mean median mode variance etc so its make very easily 
5.Batch operation: so function and custom transform(a unique code written to modify data  ) easily using numpy
