## Feature scaling 
so it's a part of Feature engineerning, so it's a Data preprocessing technique used  for changes the range of numerical values to be similar scale.(finding tough to understand let me make easy for u )

First we of all we are going to talk about Data prepocessing 
Data processing : data always in avaiable first in raw form with alot of or mistake,misssing values,inconsistent,random,duplicate,correct incorrect,repettition etc. so we need first to perform some process over this raw to conver it preprocessed data.this processed data is ready to use in the traning model.

So now head  back to the defination of the Feature scaling,so the techniques comes in to the preprocessing where it  change the range of numerical values to the similar scale,so that all the values  look same for machine  model and using that without any problem and predict with accuracy.
Question:So,now let look what Feature scaling do?.
Sol:For this question we are going to take an example.lets take a dataset of any company in that we have a section called name,age and salary and we want output of employee having  least age employee with having higher salary than there above employee kind off so if we put that dataset in the machine learning model it couldn't understand that the age and salary,it will consider salary as big important age small value like
salary have=6-7 digit it will assume it as Big value.
age=1,2 digit it will consider this as small value.
What will model  predict? 
It will wrong prediction,beacause it couldn't understand the values both section hold it judge based on the size 
Now Here, Feature scaling techniques comes during preprocessing  change  the range of the values to smilar scaling.
after this feature scaling techniques when model use this dataset now then he understand the value both section have 

So this is  the proper defination of Feature scaling" 
so now we are gonna talk about how it work ?
