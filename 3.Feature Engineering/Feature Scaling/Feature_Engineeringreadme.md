# Feature Engineering 
improving the dataset so that the model  can learn  patterns efficiently.improving dataset can be in done in anyway  so that the model can learn patterns efficiently.if we elaborate that Feature scaling:making the higher value and smaller value equal
As simple is the defination as simple it works too.So,let's example of adding a New Feature(coloum)to the dataset so let take any dataset having feature name,age,employee id and you the new Feature(new coloumn) Salary gets add into the dataset so you just have to write feature code for adding new feature(new coloumn) and bom!!.A new coloumn will added in to the dataset this what Feature Engineering truly is you just added a new feature to your dataset.So.doing this make your data more elaborate and elaborating more help model to learn pattern efficiently.this is one of the
ways of improving the dataset for the model to learn the pattern efficiently. 
There are so many Feature that are used in the Datasets to make them ready for traning model 
Here are some of it
### Feature Scaling:
it's a technique used in the preprocessing and used for the changing the numeric range values of the Feature to a similar scaling means make the large value containing Feature(coloumn) and small value containing Feature to a 
similar scaling or similar range.why? beacuse model get confused between Feature having large range value
(let's say salary as 6 digit's) consider it as the dominante and a Feature having smaller range value
(let's take this one Age ) as submissive (or minor) so both are important at there aspect but the model 
does not know every Feature is valuable consider every  indivuial Feature is special but the model couldn't
so there Feature Scaling comes in so make the make them equal and ready for the model to predict using this
training model.
ques.what will happended if he hasn't used the Feature Scaling to the dataset.
sol:1.Model will predict data(or output) inaccurate or wrong 
2.Model will be bias(error will come)
3.Algorithm based on the model couldn't work proper during the model evalution 
4.Model will not be work efficiently as expected to do
