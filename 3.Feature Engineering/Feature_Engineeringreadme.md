# Feature Engineering (Feature stand for new piece of advice or new piece of information)
improving the dataset so that the model  can learn  patterns efficiently.improving dataset can be in done in anyway  so that the model can learn patterns efficiently.So lets take a example of feature engineering.   
1.Feature Scale:- Converting all feature values to a similar scale (mean a feature having higher values and a feature having smaller values is feature to a equal scalar range.     
2.Feature Creation:-Adding another coloumn to the dataset.Consider you have a dataset in the dataset you have coloumn like Name,Age,Employee id and you want to add new coloumn(feature) Salary.So, by Feature Creation new coloumns can gets add into the dataset  you just have to write feature code for adding feature Creation and bom!!.A new coloumn will added in to the dataset this what Feature Engineering truly is you just added a new feature to your dataset.  
Feature Engineering makes your data more elaborate and that more elaborated data help model to learn pattern fast and efficiently.  
### There are so many Feature that are used in the Datasets to make them ready for traning model 
Here are some of it
### Feature Scaling
### Feature Creation
### Feature Encoding 
### Feature Selection
